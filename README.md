# push_swap
This project is an algorithm project: data needs to be sorted

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
optimized data sorting.

You can use the binary file 'checker_linux' like this:
- $> *ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_OS $ARG*
   OK
